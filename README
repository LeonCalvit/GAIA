This software is used to download data published from the GAIA astronomical telescope.  The entire dataset is hundreds of
gigabytes large, so this program only downloads and analyszes a small sample of it.  Running the main.py script
downloads the first 400 files from the website, and scrapes the relevant data while discrading the rest.  The file size on disk is
~160 MB, along with a smaller sample of the data that is used for clustering analysis.

Linear and quadratic regression is run on the main smaple of the data.  Some hyperparameter
tuning is done for the qudratic regression, up to 9 degrees of freedom.  The correlations are simply printed out.

A plot of temperature vs. luminosity is output to demonstrate the correlation that is present but under represented
by the numbers alone.

Finally, K-means cluster analysis is done on the small subset of the data.

Main.py is the file that scrapes and cleans the data from http://cdn.gea.esac.esa.int/Gaia/gdr2/gaia_source/csv/.
It selects 9 columns from the CSV files from the website and creates a new CSV file used for testing. plots.py creates
the graphs and analyzes the data created from Main.py for our project. To run these files, Python 3 must be installed.
First run Main.py first to create the CSV file of data, then run plots.py to get the analysis number as well as the graphs
for the data. This project does not have a demo to run.
